```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py`:
- Around line 886-973: The validate_batch function currently filters out missing
issue IDs which can bypass the batch-size limit and then creating a semaphore
with max_concurrent <= 0 will deadlock; fix by (1) validating input issues
up-front: ensure every issue dict has a non-empty "id" and if any are missing
raise ValueError (so validate_batch_limit is called on the full list and
cache-key errors are avoided), and (2) guard max_concurrent by validating it is
an int > 0 (raise ValueError if not) or clamp it to at least 1 before creating
the asyncio.Semaphore; update references in validate_batch to use the original
issues list and keep validate_with_semaphore, semaphore, and calls to
validate_ticket unchanged.
```
