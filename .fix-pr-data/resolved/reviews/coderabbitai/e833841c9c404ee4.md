In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`:
- Around line 210-215: The date rendering in LinearTicketDetail currently uses
new Date(ticket.createdAt).toLocaleDateString(), which can vary by user locale;
change this to use an explicit formatter (e.g., Intl.DateTimeFormat with a
specified locale and options or your app i18n date formatter) when rendering the
createdAt value so the output is consistent across users; update the JSX in
LinearTicketDetail where the div currently contains new
Date(ticket.createdAt).toLocaleDateString() to call the chosen formatter
(keeping the same element and role attributes).
- Around line 250-295: The custom ReactMarkdown component props currently use
`any` in the code and a renderers (the inline function labeled code and the link
function labeled a); replace those `any` types with proper ReactMarkdown
component types by importing the Components type from 'react-markdown' (import
type { Components } from 'react-markdown') and then annotate the functions as
(props: Components['code']) => JSX.Element and (props: Components['a']) =>
JSX.Element (or destructure with const { inline, className, children } = props:
Components['code']), updating both the code(...) and a(...) parameter types
accordingly so TypeScript strict mode is satisfied.
