In `@apps/frontend/src/main/ipc-handlers/linear-handlers.ts`:
- Around line 44-56: The getLinearApiKey function (and other path-building sites
in this file) currently uses path.join which is not cross-platform safe for our
Electron contexts; import and use the platform helper joinPaths instead of
path.join inside getLinearApiKey (and replace the other path.join usages in this
file) so paths are normalized consistently; additionally, when dealing with
cross-platform executable lookup or PATH handling in this file, switch to the
platform helpers findExecutable, getPathDelimiter and requiresShell where
appropriate to follow repo guidelines.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/hooks/useLinearTickets.ts`:
- Around line 1-18: Replace the deep relative imports at the top of
useLinearTickets.ts with the configured TypeScript path aliases: import shared
types from "shared/types/integrations" instead of
"../../../../shared/types/integrations", and import store symbols (applyFilters,
fetchLinearProjects, fetchLinearTeams, fetchLinearTicket, fetchLinearTickets,
useLinearStore, validateLinearTicket, validateLinearTicketBatch) from the
renderer store using the "@/renderer/stores/linear-store" or the appropriate
alias that maps to src/renderer (e.g., "@/stores/linear-store" or "features/..."
per your tsconfig) so all imports use the project path aliases rather than
relative paths; update the import specifiers accordingly while keeping the same
imported symbols (useCallback, useEffect, etc., remain from "react").

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/stores/linear-store.ts`:
- Around line 349-378: Extract the repeated default ValidationResult object into
a single constant (e.g., DEFAULT_VALIDATION_RESULT: ValidationResult) that
contains the full default shape (contentAnalysis, completenessValidation,
suggestedLabels, versionRecommendation, taskProperties, etc.); then replace each
inline repetition in validateLinearTicket (the four places that currently spread
...(currentResult || { ... })) and in validateLinearTicketBatch with a
spread/merge of DEFAULT_VALIDATION_RESULT plus any per-instance overrides (e.g.,
{ ...DEFAULT_VALIDATION_RESULT, ticketId, ticketIdentifier: "",
validationTimestamp: new Date().toISOString(), cached: false } or spread
currentResult first when present) so the functions use the shared constant and
only override the fields that differ.
