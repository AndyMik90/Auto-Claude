```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_utils.py`:
- Around line 33-70: The async function fetch_linear_ticket currently performs
blocking I/O by calling requests.post directly; change it to offload that
synchronous HTTP call to a worker thread (e.g., wrap the requests.post +
response handling in a callable and run it via asyncio.to_thread) so the event
loop isn't blocked, or replace with an async HTTP client; ensure you preserve
the existing JSON body, headers (Authorization), timeout logic,
response.raise_for_status and the final data.get("data", {}).get("issue") return
behavior when moving the requests.post call out of the main coroutine.

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`:
- Around line 210-215: The hardcoded English strings in formatDate must be
localized: modify the component(s) that call formatDate (e.g., in
LinearTicketDetail around the createdAt render and the other block at lines
~387–405) to pass the i18n translation function t into formatDate, then update
formatDate to use translation keys (e.g., linear.time.yesterday,
linear.time.minutes, linear.time.hours, linear.time.days) with proper plural
interpolation instead of "yesterday", "m ago", "h ago", etc.; finally add those
new keys with plural forms into both en/linear.json and fr/linear.json so the
strings are translated and pluralized correctly.

In `@tests/test_analyzer_port_detection.py`:
- Around line 91-95: Replace the current skipped placeholder test
test_port_in_docker_compose with a minimal actionable expectation: either mark
it as xfail using `@pytest.mark.xfail` and assert the current behavior of
port_detector._detect_port_in_docker_compose(...) (e.g., returns None or wrong
service) to document the known limitation, or add a minimal passing assertion
that demonstrates the current detection (call
port_detector._detect_port_in_docker_compose with a small docker-compose fixture
and assert the returned port equals the expected value), or at minimum add a
comment with a tracking issue URL so the limitation is recorded.
