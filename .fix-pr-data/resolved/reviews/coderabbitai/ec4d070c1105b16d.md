```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_resolution_agent.py`:
- Around line 200-204: The loop that builds release lines (the "for release in
releases[:10]" block) always appends "..." after slicing description[:100];
change it to compute desc = release.get('description', "No description") and
only append "..." when len(desc) > 100 before adding to parts via the existing
parts.append call (use the same name/tag lookup release.get('name',
release.get('tag_name', 'unknown'))). This preserves short descriptions
unchanged and only truncates long ones with an ellipsis.
```
