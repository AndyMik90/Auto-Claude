## Original Content

**Bug:** The `Sidebar` component uses multiple undeclared variables (`isCollapsed`, `envConfig`), functions (`toggleSidebar`), and unimported components (`PanelLeft`), which will cause runtime `ReferenceError`s.
<sub>Severity: HIGH</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9287601`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Declare the missing state variables, likely using `useState`, for `isCollapsed`, `envConfig`, `githubEnabled`, and `gitlabEnabled`. Define the `toggleSidebar` function. Re-add the imports for the `PanelLeft` and `PanelLeftClose` icons from the `lucide-react` library.

Location: apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/Sidebar.tsx#L124-L151

Potential issue: The refactored `Sidebar.tsx` component references several variables,
functions, and components that are not declared or imported. Specifically, `envConfig`,
`setEnvConfig`, `githubEnabled`, `gitlabEnabled`, and `isCollapsed` are used in hooks
and JSX but are never defined. The `toggleSidebar` function is assigned to an `onClick`
handler but is not declared. Additionally, the `PanelLeft` and `PanelLeftClose` icons
are used but are no longer imported. These missing declarations will lead to
`ReferenceError` exceptions when the component renders, causing the entire sidebar to
fail.
