## Original Content

**Bug:** The `validate_batch` method in `linear_validator.py` does not accept the `skip_cache` parameter, causing batch validations to always use cached results, even when a refresh is requested.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9289493`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Update the `validate_batch` method signature in `linear_validator.py` to accept a `skip_cache` parameter. Propagate this parameter to the `validate_ticket` call within the method. Then, modify `linear_validation_runner.py` to pass the `skip_cache` argument it receives to the `validate_batch` function.

Review the code at the location below. A potential bug has been identified by an AI
agent.
Verify if this is a real issue. If it is, propose a fix; if not, explain why it's not
valid.

Location: apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py#L886-L893

Potential issue: When a user initiates a batch validation with the `skipCache` option
set to true, the request is silently ignored by the backend. The `--skip-cache`
command-line argument is correctly received by the `linear_validation_runner.py` script.
However, the script explicitly refrains from passing this parameter to the
`validate_batch` method in `linear_validator.py`. As a result, `validate_batch` proceeds
to call `validate_ticket` for each item without the `skip_cache` flag, causing each
individual validation to use its default behavior of `skip_cache=False`. This leads to
stale, cached results being returned to the user instead of fresh data.
