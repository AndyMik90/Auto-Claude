## Original Content

**Bug:** The `async` function `fetch_linear_ticket` uses the synchronous `requests.post()`, which will block the asyncio event loop when awaited.
<sub>Severity: HIGH</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9345974`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Replace the synchronous `requests.post()` call with an asynchronous equivalent from a library like `httpx` or `aiohttp`. This will ensure the HTTP request is non-blocking and integrates correctly with the asyncio event loop.

Potential issue: The `fetch_linear_ticket` function is declared as `async` and is
awaited in multiple agents, such as `LinearResolutionAgent` and `LinearSimilarityAgent`.
However, its implementation uses the synchronous `requests.post()` method with a
30-second timeout. When this function is called, it will block the entire asyncio event
loop for the duration of the HTTP request, preventing any other concurrent tasks from
executing. This will cause the application to become unresponsive during Linear API
operations, with the blocking time multiplying if multiple tickets are processed.
