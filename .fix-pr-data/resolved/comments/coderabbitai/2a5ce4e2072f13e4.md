## Original Content

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Hardcoded aria-label "Ticket metadata" violates i18n requirements.**

The aria-label on line 134 uses a hardcoded English string. Per coding guidelines, all user-facing text must use i18n translation keys.

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`
around lines 131 - 134, The hardcoded aria-label on the div in
LinearTicketDetail.tsx (the element with className "flex flex-wrap gap-2" and
role="list") must be replaced with an i18n translation key; update the component
to call the project's translation helper (e.g., useTranslation hook or t
function) and pass the translated string to aria-label (for example
t('ticket.metadata') or the appropriate key in your locale files), ensuring the
corresponding translation entry exists in the locale JSON.
