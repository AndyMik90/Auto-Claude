_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Consider removing unused `icon` property from ValidationStep type.**

The `ValidationStep` type includes an `icon` property that is assigned for each step but never used in `renderStep`. The function renders icons based on `status` instead.

```diff
 type ValidationStep = {
   id: string;
   label: string;
   status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "complete" | "error";
-  icon: typeof CheckCircle2;
 };
```

Then remove the `icon` assignments from each step object in `validationSteps`.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/ValidationModal.tsx`
around lines 109 - 170, The ValidationStep type includes an unused icon
property: validationSteps assigns icon for each step (e.g., in the objects with
id "analyze","completeness","labels","version","properties") but renderStep
renders icons based on status and never references icon; remove the icon field
from the ValidationStep type and delete the icon assignments in the
validationSteps array (or alternatively remove the icon usages only from the
type if you plan to keep assignments), and update the ValidationStep
interface/typing and any references to icon so the prop is no longer present or
required.
