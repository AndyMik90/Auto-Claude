**Add `diskcache` and `requests` to backend requirements.**

`diskcache` (line 345) and `requests` (lines 528, 566, 568) are imported and used in this module but are missing from `apps/backend/requirements.txt`. This will cause import failures at runtime. Add both dependencies to the requirements manifest.

```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py` around lines 24 - 25, The imports
for diskcache and requests are used in apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py
but are missing from the backend requirements; update
apps/backend/requirements.txt to add both package names (diskcache and requests)
with appropriate versions (or leave version pins consistent with the project's
constraints) so imports in linear_validator.py succeed at runtime.
```
