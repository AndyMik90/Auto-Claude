**Stale comment - hooks are implemented.**

The comment mentions "will be implemented in subtask-5-2" but the hooks are already implemented in this PR.

```diff
-// Placeholder exports - will be implemented in subtask-5-2

3, Remove the stale placeholder comment and replace it with an accurate brief
description (or delete it entirely) because the hooks useLinearTickets and
useLinearFiltering are already implemented; update the top-of-file comment in
the file that exports useLinearTickets and useLinearFiltering so it no longer
says "will be implemented in subtask-5-2" and instead reflects the current state
(e.g., "Exports implemented hooks: useLinearTickets, useLinearFiltering").
