```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearFilterBar.tsx`
around lines 7 - 18, The import list in LinearFilterBar.tsx includes an unused
type "Filter" from "lucide-react"; remove "Filter" from the import specifier
(the import statement that currently lists Badge as BadgeIcon, Check, type
Filter, Flag, ...) so the component no longer imports an unused symbol and
ESLint/typecheck warnings are resolved.
