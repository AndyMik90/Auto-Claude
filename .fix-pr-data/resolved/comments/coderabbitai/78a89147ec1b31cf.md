_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Incorrect i18n namespace configuration.**

Line 91 uses `useTranslation("common")` (single namespace), but the component uses `linear:` prefix throughout (lines 79, 318, 321, 342, 344, 366, 369, 421). When a single namespace string is provided, the colon notation to access other namespaces may not work as expected.

<summary>🔧 Fix namespace configuration</summary>

```diff
- const { t } = useTranslation("common");
+ const { t } = useTranslation(["common", "linear"]);
```

This ensures both namespaces are loaded and the colon notation works correctly throughout the component.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/LinearDashboard.tsx` at line 91,
The component's i18n hook call useTranslation currently passes a single
namespace string which prevents the "linear:" colon-prefixed keys from
resolving; update the call in the LinearDashboard component to request both
namespaces (include "linear" alongside "common") so the colon notation (e.g.,
"linear:...") works across the component and ensure any downstream uses of the
returned t function reference the combined namespaces.
```
