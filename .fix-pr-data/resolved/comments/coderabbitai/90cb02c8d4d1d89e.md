_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Placeholder implementations return hardcoded data; ensure they don't leak into production.**

The `_get_recent_commits` and `_get_recent_releases` functions return hardcoded sample data. While marked with TODO comments, this could produce misleading results if deployed before real git/GitHub integration is implemented.



Consider adding a warning log or raising an error in non-development environments to prevent accidental use of placeholder data. Would you like me to open an issue to track the implementation of actual git/GitHub integration?

In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_resolution_agent.py` around lines 360 - 400, The
placeholder functions _get_recent_commits and _get_recent_releases currently
return hardcoded data; update them so they do not silently run in production by
detecting the environment (e.g., an ENV var or existing config flag) and either
log a clear warning via the project's logger or raise an exception when not in
development/test, and keep the current hardcoded return only for explicit
dev/test flows; specifically modify _get_recent_commits and _get_recent_releases
to check a runtime flag (e.g., IS_DEV or settings.DEBUG), call the project's
logger to emit a warning that placeholder data is being used, and raise an error
(or return an empty list) when running in non-development environments to
prevent accidental production use.
