**Add error handling or await the promise.**

The `startSpecCreation()` method returns `Promise<void>` but is called without `await` or `.catch()` handling. While the implementation emits errors via events rather than rejecting the promise, the fire-and-forget approach prevents the caller from knowing when the task completes or handling errors properly. Either `await` the call or attach proper error handlers to ensure errors are not silently lost.

In `@apps/frontend/src/main/ipc-handlers/linear-handlers.ts` around lines 586 -
593, The call to agentManager.startSpecCreation(specId, project.path,
description, specDir, metadata) is fire-and-forget even though startSpecCreation
returns Promise<void>, so update the caller to either await the promise inside
an async function or attach a .catch() to handle errors; specifically wrap the
call in a try/catch and await agentManager.startSpecCreation(...) (or at minimum
append .catch(err => processLogger.error(...)) or emit an error event) so
completion and failures from startSpecCreation are surfaced and not silently
lost.
