**Fallback completeness schema doesn’t match the requested output format.**  
You return `"feasibility"` as a string, but the prompt specifies `"feasibility_score"` (0–100). This will break consumers expecting the documented schema.

In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py` around lines 850 - 867, The fallback
return in linear_validator.py returns a completeness field with "feasibility" as
a string but the schema expects "feasibility_score" (0–100); update the fallback
object returned by the function that builds the minimal result (the dict using
issue_id, issue_data, current_version) to replace "feasibility":
"needs_clarification" with a numeric "feasibility_score" (e.g., 0 or a sentinel
like -1 if unknown) and ensure any downstream key "rating" remains consistent
with the documented schema; use issue_data, issue_id, and current_version
symbols in the same object and keep the rest of the fields unchanged.
