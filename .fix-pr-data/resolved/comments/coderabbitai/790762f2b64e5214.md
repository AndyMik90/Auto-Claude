## Original Content

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Add explicit `type="button"` to prevent unintended form submission.**

The button element defaults to `type="submit"`, which can cause unintended form submissions if this component is ever used within a `<form>`. As indicated by static analysis.

[error] 163-169: Provide an explicit type prop for the button element.

The default type of a button is submit, which causes the submission of a form when placed inside a `form` element. This is likely not the behaviour that you want inside a React application.
Allowed button types are: submit, button or reset

(lint/a11y/useButtonType)

In

around lines 163 - 181, The button in the LinearTicketDetail component is
missing an explicit type and will default to type="submit", causing unintended
form submissions; update the JSX for the button rendered in LinearTicketDetail
(the element using onClick={handleValidate}, disabled={isValidating},
aria-label={t('linear:validateTicket')}) to include type="button" so it will not
submit any parent form.
