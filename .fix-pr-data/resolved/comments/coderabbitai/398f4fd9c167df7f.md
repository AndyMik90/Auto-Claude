🌐 Web query:

`Linear API authorization header format Bearer token`

💡 Result:

For Linear’s API, send your access token in the HTTP `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

This applies to both the GraphQL API (`https://api.linear.app/graphql`) and file downloads from `https://uploads.linear.app`. [1], [2]

**Add Bearer prefix to Linear API Authorization header.**  
Linear's API requires the Authorization header to use the Bearer scheme. The current raw API key will result in a 401 Unauthorized error. Apply the suggested fix to prefix the token with "Bearer ".

         headers = {
-            "Authorization": api_key,
+            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
             "Content-Type": "application/json",

In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py` around lines 466 - 524, The
Authorization header is currently set to the raw api_key which causes 401s;
update the headers creation (where api_key is read and headers dict is built for
requests.post) to prefix the token with "Bearer " (e.g., use the string "Bearer
" + api_key) so the Authorization value follows the Bearer scheme expected by
Linear's GraphQL API; adjust the headers variable used in the requests.post call
accordingly.
