_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Consider using semantic `<output>` element for status regions.**

Biome suggests using `<output>` instead of `<div role="status">` for better semantic HTML. This applies to lines 110, 142, 166, and 193.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketList.tsx`
around lines 110 - 118, Replace the non-semantic divs used as status regions
with semantic output elements: locate the JSX elements in LinearTicketList that
render the loading and other status regions (the divs with role="status"
aria-live="polite" aria-busy and aria-label attributes, including the block that
renders TicketItemSkeleton via Array.from and the similar blocks around lines
referenced in the review) and change them to use <output> while preserving all
accessibility attributes (aria-live, aria-busy, aria-label) and className
values; ensure the component still returns valid JSX and that any tests or
styles expecting a div are updated to accept an output element where needed.
