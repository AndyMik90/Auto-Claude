_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Remove unused imports.**

`useLinearStore` (line 4) and `useToast` (line 6) are imported but never used in this component.

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`
around lines 4 - 6, Remove the unused imports useLinearStore and useToast from
LinearTicketDetail.tsx: locate the import line that brings in useLinearStore
from '../../../../stores/linear-store' and the import of useToast from
'../../../../hooks/use-toast' and delete those two named imports so only used
imports (e.g., ValidationModal) remain; ensure no other references to
useLinearStore or useToast exist in the LinearTicketDetail component and run a
typecheck/build to confirm import cleanup.
```
