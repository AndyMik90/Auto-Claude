_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Prefer static import over dynamic `require`.**

Using `require("child_process")` dynamically inside the method is unconventional. Since this is a main process file, use a static import at the top of the file for better type safety and consistency with the existing `import { existsSync } from 'fs'` pattern.



Add to imports at top of file:
```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';
```

In `@apps/frontend/src/main/agent/agent-manager.ts` around lines 535 - 536, The
code uses a dynamic require("child_process") inside the method; replace it with
a static top-level import to match the project's style: add "import { spawn }
from 'child_process';" to the file's imports and remove the inline require call
where spawn is currently being fetched, leaving the existing use of
this.processManager.getPythonPath() and subsequent calls that reference spawn
untouched.
