_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Avoid `as any` type assertion.**

The `data: undefined as any` is a workaround that could be cleaner. If `clearLinearCache` returns `void`, the mock should reflect this properly.

<summary>🔧 Suggested fix</summary>

```diff
-    clearLinearCache: async () => ({ success: true, data: undefined as any })
+    clearLinearCache: async () => ({ success: true, data: undefined })
```

If the type system still complains, consider updating the `IPCResult<void>` type definition to properly handle void returns.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/lib/browser-mock.ts` at line 289, The mock uses a
bogus type assertion "data: undefined as any" in clearLinearCache; change the
returned shape to match a void result instead — e.g., return { success: true,
data: undefined } with the correct typing or adjust the IPCResult<void> generic
so it accepts data?: undefined; update the clearLinearCache mock (function
clearLinearCache) to return the properly typed IPCResult<void> rather than using
"as any".
