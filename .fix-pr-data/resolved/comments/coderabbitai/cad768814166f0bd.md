**Add `type="button"` to the clear-search control for explicit semantic intent.**

While this button is not currently inside a form, explicitly setting `type="button"` clarifies intent and improves code clarity for maintainers.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearFilterBar.tsx`
around lines 536 - 542, The clear-search control button in LinearFilterBar (the
element rendering <button onClick={() => onSearchChange("")} ...> with the X
icon) should explicitly declare its intent by adding type="button"; update the
button element rendering the clear control so it includes type="button" to avoid
default submit behavior if later placed inside a form and to clarify semantic
intent for maintainers.
