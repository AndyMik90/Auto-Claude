**Drive validation UI from `validation.status` rather than presence.**

`validationResult` exists for `"validating"`/`"error"` states, so the badge and summary currently show “Validated/Validation Complete” even when validation isn’t complete. Gate these sections on `status === "complete"` (and optionally add explicit UI for `"validating"`/`"error"`).

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`
around lines 105 - 131, The validation badge is driven by the presence of
validation instead of its status, causing "Validated" to show even when
validationResult.status is "validating" or "error"; update the conditional in
LinearTicketDetail (where the validation badge/rendering occurs) to check
validation.status === "complete" (instead of truthiness) and similarly gate the
summary and any other validation UI (see references to validation and
validationResult) so only the "complete" state shows the success badge;
optionally add explicit branches for validation.status === "validating" and
validation.status === "error" to render in-progress or error badges/messages.
