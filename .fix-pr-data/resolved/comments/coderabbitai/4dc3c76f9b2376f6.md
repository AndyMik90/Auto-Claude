## Original Content

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Remove unused `pytest` import.**

The `pytest` import is not directly used in this file. Test fixtures (`temp_dir`, `temp_git_repo`, `stage_files`) are discovered via conftest.py and don't require an explicit import.

```
In `@tests/test_scan_secrets.py` at line 15, Remove the unused top-level import
"import pytest" from the test module; the test fixtures (temp_dir,
temp_git_repo, stage_files) are discovered via conftest.py so no explicit pytest
import is needed—delete the "pytest" import statement to resolve the unused
import warning.
