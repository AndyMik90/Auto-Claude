**Missing `collapseSidebar` and `expandSidebar` keys still referenced in Sidebar.tsx.**

The `actions` section is missing `collapseSidebar` and `expandSidebar` keys, but `Sidebar.tsx` (lines 361, 371) still references them via `t('actions.expandSidebar')` and `t('actions.collapseSidebar')`.

Either add the missing keys or update the component to use alternative keys.

In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/navigation.json` around lines 22 -
26, The FR locale is missing the actions.collapseSidebar and
actions.expandSidebar keys referenced from Sidebar.tsx
(t('actions.expandSidebar') and t('actions.collapseSidebar')); add these two
keys under the "actions" object in
apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/navigation.json with appropriate French
translations (e.g., for collapsing/expanding the sidebar) so the translation
lookups in Sidebar.tsx resolve.
