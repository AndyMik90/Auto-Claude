**Missing `collapseSidebar` and `expandSidebar` keys still referenced in Sidebar.tsx.**

Same issue as the French locale - the `actions` section is missing `collapseSidebar` and `expandSidebar` keys that are still referenced in `Sidebar.tsx`.

In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/en/navigation.json` around lines 22 -
26, The English locale's actions object in navigation.json is missing the
collapseSidebar and expandSidebar keys referenced by Sidebar.tsx; add
"collapseSidebar": "Collapse sidebar" and "expandSidebar": "Expand sidebar" (or
appropriate copy) into the existing "actions" object so Sidebar.tsx can read
those i18n keys (ensure key names match exactly: collapseSidebar and
expandSidebar).
