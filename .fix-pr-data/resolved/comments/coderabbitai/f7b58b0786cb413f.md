_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Redundant import — `MagicMock` is already imported at module level.**

Line 16 already imports `MagicMock` from `unittest.mock`. This local import with alias adds unnecessary indirection.

```diff
         from dataclasses import dataclass
-        from unittest.mock import MagicMock as Mock
```

Then on line 667, use `MagicMock` directly:

```diff
-        validator.validate_spec_document = Mock(side_effect=validate_spec_side_effect)
+        validator.validate_spec_document = MagicMock(side_effect=validate_spec_side_effect)
```

In `@tests/test_spec_phases.py` around lines 646 - 647, The test file redundantly
re-imports MagicMock as Mock in the local scope; remove the local "from
unittest.mock import MagicMock as Mock" import and update any uses of Mock in
this block (e.g., where Mock() is instantiated) to use the module-level
MagicMock directly (replace Mock with MagicMock) so there is no aliasing
indirection and the single module-level import is used consistently.
