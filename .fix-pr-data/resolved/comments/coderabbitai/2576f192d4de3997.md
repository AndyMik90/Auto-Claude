**Move this file to the correct location to avoid duplicate directory nesting.**

The file is currently at `apps/frontend/apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/index.ts` but should be at `apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/index.ts`. The duplicate `apps/frontend` path segment indicates incorrect file placement. This file needs to be repositioned before it can be properly integrated with the existing Linear components structure.

```
In
`@apps/frontend/apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/index.ts`
around lines 1 - 6, This module that exports ValidationModal and LinearFilterBar
is placed in the wrong nested frontend folder; relocate the index.ts that
contains the exports (the file exporting ValidationModal and LinearFilterBar)
into the existing linear/components directory under the frontend renderer so it
matches the other Linear component files and remove the duplicate nested folder;
after moving, update any import paths referencing this index to point to the new
location and verify there are no remaining duplicate directories or broken
imports.

## Implementation Notes

*Status: SKIPPED*

**Resolution:** Duplicate apps/frontend/apps/ directory no longer exists (verified via ls)
