## Original Content

**Bug:** The AI prompt returns a `feasibility` string, but the backend serializer expects a numeric `feasibility_score`, causing the frontend to always display a 0% feasibility score.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9307687`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Modify the AI prompt in `apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py` to request a numeric `feasibility_score` (ranging from 0-100) instead of the textual `feasibility` field. This will align the data produced by the AI with the data expected by the backend serializer and the frontend component.

Review the code at the location below. A potential bug has been identified by an AI
agent.
Verify if this is a real issue. If it is, propose a fix; if not, explain why it's not
valid.

Location: apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py#L720-L729

Potential issue: There is a data contract mismatch between the AI agent and the backend
serializer. The AI prompt in `linear_validator.py` is configured to return a textual
`feasibility` field (e.g., "feasible"). However, the serializer in
`linear_validation_runner.py` attempts to read a numeric `feasibility_score` field,
defaulting to 0.0 when it's not found. The frontend `ValidationResult` interface expects
a numeric `feasibilityScore`. Consequently, the UI will always display a misleading
"Feasibility: 0%" in the validation modal for all Linear tickets, regardless of the
actual AI assessment.
