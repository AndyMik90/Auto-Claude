## Original Content

**Bug:** The backend sends validation results using the field `validationNotes`, but the frontend expects this data under `feasibilityReasoning`, leading to missing data in the UI.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9311029`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Align the field names between the backend and frontend. The recommended approach is to modify the backend serializer in `apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py` to return `feasibilityReasoning` instead of `validationNotes` to match the frontend's expectation.

Location: apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py#L88

Potential issue: A mismatch exists between the backend and frontend for validation
results. The backend serializer at `apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py`
sends a field named `validationNotes`. However, the frontend's TypeScript type
definition and `ValidationModal.tsx` component expect a field named
`feasibilityReasoning`. As a result,
`validation.completenessValidation.feasibilityReasoning` will be `undefined` at runtime,
causing the UI to display `undefined` instead of the AI's reasoning for the feasibility
score. This degrades the user experience by hiding important validation context.
