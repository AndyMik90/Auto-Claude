## Original Content

**Bug:** The `useLinearTickets` hook is called twice, creating two instances and causing duplicate data-fetching effects and redundant API calls on every component render.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9008189`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Consolidate the two calls to the `useLinearTickets` hook. Add `validationResults` to the destructuring assignment of the first hook call on line 77 and remove the redundant second call on line 95.

Location: apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/LinearDashboard.tsx#L94-L95

Potential issue: The `LinearDashboard` component invokes the `useLinearTickets` hook
twice, on lines 77-92 and again on line 95. This creates two separate, independent
instances of the hook, each with its own state and effects. The hook contains a
`useEffect` that triggers data fetching via API calls. Because both hook instances
execute this effect, the component makes duplicate network requests to the Linear API on
every render. This results in unnecessary server load and wasted bandwidth, and could
lead to rate-limiting issues. The second call is only to access `validationResults`,
which is already available from the first hook call.
