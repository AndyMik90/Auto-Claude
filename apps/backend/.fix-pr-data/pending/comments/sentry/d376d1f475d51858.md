## Original Content

**Bug:** The `feasibilityReasoning` field is incorrectly populated with a status enum (`rating`) from the AI response, instead of the expected detailed explanatory text.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9311799`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Update the serializer in `linear_validation_runner.py`. The AI prompt should be updated to request a separate field for detailed reasoning, and the serializer should map this new field to `feasibilityReasoning` instead of using `completeness.get("rating", "")`.

Verify if this is a real issue. If it is, propose a fix; if not, explain why it's not
valid.

Potential issue: In `linear_validation_runner.py`, the serializer incorrectly maps the
AI's `rating` output (an enum like `"complete"` or `"needs_clarification"`) to the
`feasibilityReasoning` field. The frontend component `ValidationModal.tsx` expects
`feasibilityReasoning` to be a detailed explanatory string, but instead receives a
single-word status. This results in a degraded user experience, as the UI displays a
categorical status instead of the intended detailed reasoning for a ticket's feasibility
assessment.
