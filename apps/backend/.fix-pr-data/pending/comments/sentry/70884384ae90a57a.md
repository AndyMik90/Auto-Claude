## Original Content

**Bug:** The backend serializes the feasibility score as `score`, but the frontend expects `feasibilityScore`, causing the value to be undefined in the UI.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9292082`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

In `apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py`, rename the key `"score"` to `"feasibilityScore"` in the returned dictionary to match the field name expected by the frontend TypeScript interface.

Location: apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py#L89

Potential issue: In `linear_validation_runner.py`, the completeness validation result is
serialized with a field named `score`. However, the frontend TypeScript interface,
defined in `integrations.ts`, expects this field to be named `feasibilityScore`. This
mismatch will cause the `ValidationModal.tsx` component to access an undefined property
(`validation.completenessValidation.feasibilityScore`), resulting in the feasibility
score not being displayed in the UI.
