_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Add missing `linear.adjustFiltersHint` translation.**

`LinearDashboard` renders `t("linear:adjustFiltersHint")`, but this key isn’t defined here, so users will see the raw key. Add it to both `en` and `fr` locales.

```diff
  "linear": {
     "tickets": "Tickets",
+    "adjustFiltersHint": "Try adjusting your filters or search terms",
     "ticketsList": "Linear tickets list",
```
</details>

As per coding guidelines, all frontend user-facing text must use react-i18next translation keys and add keys to both en/*.json and fr/*.json.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/en/common.json` around lines 382 - 433,
LinearDashboard calls t("linear:adjustFiltersHint") but the key
linear.adjustFiltersHint is missing from the locale files; add the key with an
appropriate English string to
apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/en/common.json under the "linear" object
(e.g., a short hint like "Adjust filters to show more tickets") and add the
corresponding French translation to the matching fr/common.json so both locales
contain linear.adjustFiltersHint.
