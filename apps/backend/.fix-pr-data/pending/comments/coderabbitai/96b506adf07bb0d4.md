**Empty team filter block - no-op code.**

The `teamId` filter condition has an empty body with only a comment. This filter is silently ignored, which may confuse maintainers and cause unexpected behavior when users attempt to filter by team.

Either implement the filter or remove the dead code branch entirely.

```diff
 function applyFilters(tickets: LinearTicket[], filters: LinearFilters): LinearTicket[] {
   return tickets.filter((ticket) => {
-    // Filter by team
-    if (filters.teamId) {
-      // Note: Linear API doesn't return team info in issue response
-      // This filter would need to be applied server-side or via additional data
-      // For now, we'll include this as a placeholder
-    }
+    // Note: teamId filter is applied server-side via fetchLinearTickets
+    // as Linear API doesn't return team info in issue responses
 
     // Filter by project

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/stores/linear-store.ts` around lines 92 - 99, The
teamId branch in applyFilters is a no-op; either implement the client-side
filter or remove it. If you can filter client-side, add logic inside
applyFilters to return tickets.filter by comparing the ticket's team identifier
(e.g., ticket.team?.id or ticket.teamId on LinearTicket) to filters.teamId;
ensure you handle missing team data safely (undefined). If client-side filtering
isn't possible due to missing team info from the API, delete the empty if
(filters.teamId) block (and its placeholder comment) to avoid misleading dead
code and include a TODO comment referencing server-side filtering in its place.
