## Original Content

_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Team filter is a non-functional placeholder.**

The team filter block contains only a comment indicating it's not implemented. This could confuse consumers of the hook who expect `setTeamFilter` to work.

Consider either:
1. Adding a `TODO` comment with a tracking issue
2. Removing `teamId` from `LinearFilters` until implemented
3. Documenting this limitation in the interface JSDoc

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/hooks/useLinearFiltering.ts`
around lines 76 - 81, The team filter branch in useLinearFiltering (check
currentFilters.teamId in useLinearFiltering.ts) is a non-functional placeholder
and should be clarified or removed; either (A) add a TODO with a link to a
tracking issue above the if-block and update the JSDoc for the hook to document
that team filtering is not yet supported, or (B) remove teamId from the
LinearFilters type and any setTeamFilter usages so callers cannot expect it to
work—prefer the option that matches project policy (if keeping the field, ensure
setTeamFilter is a no-op with a clear TODO/JSDoc and link to the issue).
