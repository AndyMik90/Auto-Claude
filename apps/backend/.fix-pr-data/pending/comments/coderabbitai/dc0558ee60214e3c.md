**Localize the combined close reason.**

`combinedReason` is user-facing (sent to Linear) but hardcoded. Use a translation key with interpolation and add it to both locale files.

<summary>🌐 Suggested fix</summary>

```diff
- const combinedReason = `Closed as resolved: ${reasons.join("; ")}`;
+ const combinedReason = t("linear:combinedCloseReason", {
+   reasons: reasons.join("; "),
+ });
```

Add to `en/linear.json`:
```json
"combinedCloseReason": "Closed as resolved: {{reasons}}"
```

Add to `fr/linear.json`:
```json
"combinedCloseReason": "Fermé comme résolu : {{reasons}}"
```

```
In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/ResolutionCheckDialog.tsx`
around lines 85 - 92, The combined close reason string in handleCloseSelected is
hardcoded and must be localized; update handleCloseSelected to use the i18n
translation key (e.g., call t('combinedCloseReason', { reasons: reasons.join(";
") })) when building combinedReason and pass that to onCloseTickets, and add the
key "combinedCloseReason": "Closed as resolved: {{reasons}}" to en/linear.json
and "combinedCloseReason": "Fermé comme résolu : {{reasons}}" to fr/linear.json
so interpolation works for both locales.
```
