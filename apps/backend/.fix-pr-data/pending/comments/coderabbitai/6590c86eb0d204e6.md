**Remove unused `onLoadMore` from effect dependencies.**

`onLoadMore` is in the dependency array but isn't used directly in the effect body. It's already captured by `handleIntersection` which is in the dependencies. This causes unnecessary observer recreation.

```diff
   useEffect(() => {
     const trigger = loadMoreTriggerRef.current;
     if (!trigger || !viewportElement) return;

     const observer = new IntersectionObserver(handleIntersection, {
       root: viewportElement,
       rootMargin: "100px",
       threshold: 0,
     });

     observer.observe(trigger);

     return () => {
       observer.disconnect();
     };
-  }, [handleIntersection, onLoadMore, viewportElement]);
+  }, [handleIntersection, viewportElement]);

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketList.tsx`
around lines 93 - 108, The useEffect that sets up the IntersectionObserver
unnecessarily includes onLoadMore in its dependency array, causing needless
observer recreation; remove onLoadMore from the dependencies and keep
handleIntersection, loadMoreTriggerRef/current (implicitly used via trigger) and
viewportElement so the effect only re-runs when the actual observer inputs
change (update the dependency array referenced in the useEffect that observes
loadMoreTriggerRef and creates the IntersectionObserver).
