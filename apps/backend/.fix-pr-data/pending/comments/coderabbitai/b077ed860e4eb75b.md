**Import `ReactNode` and `MouseEvent` from React to fix TypeScript errors in strict mode.**

`React.ReactNode` on line 10 and `React.MouseEvent` on line 272 are referenced without React in scope. While the modern JSX transform doesn't require importing React for JSX syntax, accessing React namespace members requires the import.

<summary>🐛 Proposed fix</summary>

```diff
import { Clock, User } from "lucide-react";
+import type { ReactNode } from "react";
+import { MouseEvent } from "react";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

-function SrOnly({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
+function SrOnly({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {

-const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
+const handleClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketItem.tsx`
around lines 10 - 15, The file references React namespace types but doesn't
import them; add a named import from React (e.g., import React, { ReactNode,
MouseEvent } from 'react' or at minimum import { ReactNode, MouseEvent } from
'react') so usages in SrOnly ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) and any
event handler signatures (e.g., onClick handlers typed with MouseEvent) compile
under strict TypeScript; update the top of the file to include these imports and
adjust any existing React.* type references to use the imported names if
desired.
