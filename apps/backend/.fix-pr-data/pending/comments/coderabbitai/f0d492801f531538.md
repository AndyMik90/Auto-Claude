**Add pluralization keys for `related` to match count usage in both `en` and `fr` locale files.**  
`TicketLinkingBadge` calls `t("linear:related", { count })` on line 101; `related` lacks `_one/_other` forms while `duplicate` has them. Add these plural forms to both `en/linear.json` and `fr/linear.json` for consistent i18next pluralization.

<summary>🔧 Proposed fix</summary>

For `en/linear.json`:
```diff
  "related": "related",
+ "related_one": "related",
+ "related_other": "related",
```

For `fr/linear.json`:
```diff
  "related": "lié",
+ "related_one": "lié",
+ "related_other": "lié",
```

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/en/linear.json` around lines 95 - 96,
The locales are missing i18next plural forms for the "related" key but
TicketLinkingBadge calls t("linear:related", { count }) so add plural keys
"related_one" and "related_other" (or the i18next preferred
"related_one"/"related_other") into both en/linear.json and fr/linear.json;
update the "related" entry to include singular and plural strings (e.g.,
"related_one": "related", "related_other": "related") in en and appropriate
French translations in fr so pluralization works when TicketLinkingBadge passes
count.
