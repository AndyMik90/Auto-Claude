```
In `@guides/linear-integration.md` at line 129, Replace the unhyphenated compound
adjective "high priority" in the sentence starting with "**Patch increment**
(e.g., 2.7.4 → 2.7.5): Bug fixes, especially critical/high priority" with the
hyphenated form "high-priority" so the phrase reads "Bug fixes, especially
critical/high-priority" to use correct compound-adjective grammar.
