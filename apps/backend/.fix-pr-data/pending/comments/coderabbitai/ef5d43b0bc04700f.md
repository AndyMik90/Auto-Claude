_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Consider making path manipulation more robust.**

The `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))` pattern works but can be fragile. Consider using relative imports or ensuring the package is properly installed.



This is a minor concern since it's a CLI runner script, but documenting the expected execution context would help maintainability.

```
In `@apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py` around lines 27 - 28, The
current sys.path insertion (sys.path.insert(0,
str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))) is fragile; replace it with a robust
approach by either converting it to a resolved absolute path and guarding
against duplicate inserts (e.g., compute p =
Path(__file__).parent.parent.resolve(); if str(p) not in sys.path:
sys.path.insert(0, str(p))) or, preferably, remove the manipulation and use
package-relative imports (make the repo package-installable or use a proper
relative import) and document the expected execution context for
linear_validation_runner.py; update the top-of-file comment to state how the
script must be executed if you keep the sys.path hack.
