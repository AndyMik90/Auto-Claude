_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Minor: Redundant import.**

`MagicMock` is already imported at the module level (line 17). This inner import is unnecessary since the module-level import is already in scope.

In `@tests/conftest.py` around lines 712 - 713, Remove the redundant inner import
of MagicMock in the local import block: keep "from dataclasses import dataclass"
but drop "from unittest.mock import MagicMock" since MagicMock is already
imported at module scope; ensure there is no local variable shadowing of
MagicMock elsewhere in the same scope and run tests to verify nothing breaks.
