## Original Content

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Remove unused imports.**

`AsyncMock` and `patch` are imported but never used in this test file. Only `MagicMock` is actually needed for mocking the Claude SDK modules.

In `@tests/test_spec_complexity.py` at line 17, The import line currently brings
in AsyncMock and patch which are unused; edit the import statement that contains
AsyncMock, MagicMock, patch (referenced symbols AsyncMock and patch) to remove
the unused names and only import MagicMock (so use e.g. from unittest.mock
import MagicMock) and ensure any tests still reference MagicMock for mocking the
Claude SDK modules.
