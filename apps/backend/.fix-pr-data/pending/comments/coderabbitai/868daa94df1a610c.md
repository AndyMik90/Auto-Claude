**`common:loading` key is missing—use an existing loading label or add one.**

`common:loading` isn’t defined in the locale file, so the UI will render the raw key. Prefer the existing `labels.loading` key or add a root `loading` key in both locales.

As per coding guidelines, all frontend user-facing text must use react-i18next translation keys and add keys to both en/*.json and fr/*.json.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/LinearDashboard.tsx` around
lines 358 - 364, In LinearDashboard.tsx the tooltip uses t("common:loading")
which is not present in locales, so update the translation usage and/or locale
files: replace t("common:loading") with the existing key t("labels.loading") in
the TooltipContent (reference isLoading and the t(...) call inside the
LinearDashboard component), or alternatively add a new "loading" key under
"common" to both en/*.json and fr/*.json; ensure you modify the locale JSONs for
both languages and keep the TooltipContent and LinearDashboard t(...) call
consistent with the added key.
