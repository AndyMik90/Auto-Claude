## Original Content

_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Misleading comment placement reduces clarity.**

The comment on line 15 describes the path manipulation on line 23, but it's placed directly above the `import sys` statement, making it appear to annotate the import itself. Consider moving the comment to line 22 (directly above the path manipulation) or consolidating:

In `@tests/test_security_scanner.py` around lines 14 - 23, The comment "Add
auto-claude to path for imports" is placed above unrelated imports which is
misleading; move that comment so it sits directly above the sys.path.insert(0,
...) call (or consolidate it on the same line) to clearly document why the path
is being modified (search for sys.path.insert in tests/test_security_scanner.py
to locate the change) and ensure imports (import sys, import tempfile, from
pathlib import Path, etc.) remain grouped together without the misplaced
comment.
