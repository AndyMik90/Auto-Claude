**Localize the “% match” string.**  
The “match” label is hardcoded; wrap it in i18n with interpolation.

```diff
- {ticket.similarity_score > 0
-   ? `${Math.round(ticket.similarity_score * 100)}% match`
-   : t("linear:unknown")}
+ {ticket.similarity_score > 0
+   ? t("linear:matchPercent", {
+       percent: Math.round(ticket.similarity_score * 100),
+     })
+   : t("linear:unknown")}
```

Add `linear:matchPercent` to both `en/*.json` and `fr/*.json`.
</details>

As per coding guidelines, all frontend user-facing text MUST use `react-i18next` translation keys. Never hardcode strings in JSX/TSX.

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/SimilarIssuesDialog.tsx`
around lines 142 - 147, The “% match” label is hardcoded in SimilarIssuesDialog;
replace the literal with a react-i18next lookup using the existing translator
(t) and interpolate the percent value (e.g., use t('linear:matchPercent', {
percent: Math.round(ticket.similarity_score * 100) }) when rendering the
similarity text), and add the key linear:matchPercent to both en/*.json and
fr/*.json; also update the other occurrence in the same component that renders
the match text (the second similarity_score usage) to use the same
translated/interpolated key.
```
