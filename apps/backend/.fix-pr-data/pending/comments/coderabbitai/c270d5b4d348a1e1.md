_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Localize ARIA labels instead of hardcoded strings.**

“Loading tickets” and “Linear tickets list” are user-facing (screen readers) and must use i18n keys. Add keys in `common.json` and reference them via `t(...)`. Based on learnings, all user-facing strings must use i18n keys in TSX.

```diff
-				aria-label="Loading tickets"
+				aria-label={t("linear.loadingTickets")}
...
-				aria-label="Linear tickets list"
+				aria-label={t("linear.ticketsList")}
```

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketList.tsx`
around lines 110 - 118, The ARIA labels in LinearTicketList's loading and empty
states are hardcoded ("Loading tickets", "Linear tickets list"); update the
component (LinearTicketList) to use the i18n translator t(...) for these
user-facing strings (e.g., t('common.loadingTickets') and
t('common.linearTicketsList'), and add corresponding keys to common.json),
replacing the direct string literals for aria-label and any visible labels in
the isLoading && tickets.length === 0 block and the empty-state block (lines
around 110 and 200-206) so all screen-reader and UI text uses i18n keys.
