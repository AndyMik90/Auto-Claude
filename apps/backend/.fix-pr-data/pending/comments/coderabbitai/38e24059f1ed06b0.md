**Pagination limitation: hardcoded limit of 250 issues.**

The query fetches a maximum of 250 issues. For larger projects, users won't see all their issues. Consider implementing cursor-based pagination or documenting this limitation in the UI.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/main/ipc-handlers/linear-handlers.ts` around lines 348 -
350, The GraphQL query hardcodes "first: 250" and will miss issues beyond that;
change the query (the `query` string that uses `variablesDef` and
`filterClause`) to accept an optional cursor variable (e.g., add `$after:
String` to `variablesDef`) and include `after: $after` in the `issues(...)`
call, then implement cursor-based pagination in the handler: repeatedly execute
the query, append returned `issues.nodes` to the result, read
`pageInfo.endCursor` and `pageInfo.hasNextPage`, set `variables.after =
endCursor` and loop until `hasNextPage` is false (or until an explicit max
limit), ensuring you update the code that constructs `variablesDef`, uses
`filterClause`, and accumulates results to return the full set.
