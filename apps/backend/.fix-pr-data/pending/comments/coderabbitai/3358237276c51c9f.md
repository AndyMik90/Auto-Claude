**Add French pluralization for `related` key.**  
The `related` translation is used with a count parameter in `TicketLinkingBadge.tsx`, requiring both singular and plural forms in French.

```
In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/linear.json` around lines 95 - 96,
The French locale is missing pluralization for the "related" key used with a
count in TicketLinkingBadge.tsx; update the fr translations to provide singular
and plural forms (e.g., an ICU/plural entry or separate keys such as
"related.one"/"related.other" depending on the repo convention) so the count
parameter renders correctly in TicketLinkingBadge.tsx when passing count; ensure
the singular form corresponds to one related item and the plural form for 0 and
>1.
