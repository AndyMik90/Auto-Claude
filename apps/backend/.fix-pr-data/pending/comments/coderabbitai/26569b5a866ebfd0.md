_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Consider centralizing safe filesystem helpers.**

There are now multiple copies of `_safe_exists`/`_safe_glob` across backend modules, which risks behavioral drift. Extract a shared helper to keep consistency.  
  
As per coding guidelines: Duplicate code (copy/paste, similar logic, abstractions).

```
In `@apps/backend/analysis/test_discovery.py` around lines 32 - 88, The test
module duplicates safe filesystem helpers (_safe_exists, _safe_glob,
_safe_is_dir); extract these into a single shared utility module (e.g., a new
backend utils/fs_safe.py or existing common utilities) and replace the local
definitions with imports to that module across backend packages to avoid
divergence; ensure the shared functions keep the same signatures and exception
handling (catch PermissionError and OSError) and update unit tests/imports to
reference the centralized functions and delete the duplicated implementations
from this file.
