_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Add explicit `type="button"` to the "View Full Validation" button.**

Same issue as the validate button - missing explicit button type.

[error] 216-219: Provide an explicit type prop for the button element.

The default type of a button is submit, which causes the submission of a form when placed inside a `form` element. This is likely not the behaviour that you want inside a React application.
Allowed button types are: submit, button or reset

(lint/a11y/useButtonType)

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`
around lines 216 - 221, The "View Full Validation" button in the
LinearTicketDetail component lacks an explicit type, which can cause it to act
as a submit in forms; update the button element that calls
setShowValidationModal and renders {t('linear:viewFullValidation')} inside
LinearTicketDetail.tsx to include type="button" so it behaves as a non-submit
control.
