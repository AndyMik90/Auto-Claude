`security advisories CVE requests Python package`

💡 Result:

For a Python package, the usual paths are:

## Publish a security advisory (and optionally get a CVE)
- **GitHub Security Advisories (recommended if your code is on GitHub):** create a *draft repository security advisory* to coordinate a private fix, then publish it when ready. GitHub can **assign (reserve) a CVE** for eligible advisories (GitHub is a CVE Numbering Authority) without making the advisory public until you publish. [1], [2]

## Get the vulnerability into ecosystem advisory databases (so scanners alert users)
- **GitHub Advisory Database / Dependabot:** once you publish a GitHub advisory, GitHub reviews it and may add it to the GitHub Advisory Database and generate Dependabot alerts. [1], [3]
- **PyPA Advisory Database (community, PyPI ecosystem):** you can submit/update Python package advisories by **opening a PR** to `pypa/advisory-database` (YAML/OSV schema). [4]

## Reporting issues with PyPI itself (or malware on PyPI)
- **PyPI infrastructure vulnerability:** email **security@pypi.org** (don’t post publicly). [5]
- **Malicious package on PyPI:** use PyPI’s **“Report project as malware”** flow on the project page. [5]

## Reporting vulnerabilities in PyPA tooling (example: “packaging”)
- For the **`packaging`** project specifically: report privately to **security@python.org**. [6]

**Sources:** GitHub security advisory/CVE docs [1], [2]; GitHub Advisory Database repo [3]; PyPA advisory database contribution guide [4]; PyPI security reporting policy [5]; `packaging` security reporting page [6].

`security advisories CVE diskcache Python package`

💡 Result:

For the **Python `diskcache` package** (grantjenks/python-diskcache), I did not find any published CVE entries or vendor security advisories:

- **GitHub Security Advisories:** none published for `grantjenks/python-diskcache`. ([github.com](https://github.com/grantjenks/python-diskcache/security?utm_source=openai))  
- **Safety DB:** reports **“No known vulnerabilities found”** for `diskcache` (latest listed version **5.6.3**, released **Aug 31, 2023**). ([data.safetycli.com](https://data.safetycli.com/packages/pypi/diskcache/?utm_source=openai))  
- **ReversingLabs (Spectra Assure Community):** reports **no known vulnerabilities found** for `diskcache`. ([secure.software](https://secure.software/pypi/packages/diskcache?utm_source=openai))

If you want, tell me the `diskcache` version you’re using and your environment (e.g., local disk vs NFS), and I’ll summarize practical hardening/operational risks (even when there’s no CVE).

**Consider bumping `requests` to 2.32.5 for latest patches; `diskcache` is adequately pinned.**

No active security advisories found for either package. However, `requests>=2.31.0` is outdated relative to the latest stable `2.32.5` (released Aug 2025)—bump the minimum to `>=2.32.5` to capture recent bug fixes. The `diskcache>=5.6.0` is appropriate, as the latest stable is only `5.6.3` (Aug 2023, with no newer releases since).

```
In `@apps/backend/requirements.txt` around lines 32 - 36, Update the requirements
entry for the requests package: replace "requests>=2.31.0" with
"requests>=2.32.5" in requirements.txt to pick up the latest stable fixes; leave
the "diskcache>=5.6.0" line unchanged as noted. Ensure only that single package
line is modified and run dependency install/check to verify no conflicts.
