**Unused import: `call` from unittest.mock.**

The `call` import at line 15 is unused at the module level since it's reimported locally in the test methods that need it (lines 707, 740, etc.). Remove the unused import to clean up the module.

```
In `@apps/backend/tests/test_linear_validation.py` around lines 13 - 16, Remove
the unused top-level import "call" from the module imports in
test_linear_validation.py; the symbol is re-imported locally inside the
individual test functions (e.g., where call is used near test bodies), so delete
"call" from the line "from unittest.mock import call" (or remove that entire
import and keep only needed imports) to eliminate the unused import.
