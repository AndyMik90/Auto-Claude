## Original Content

_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Remove stale placeholder comment.**

The comment "Placeholder exports - will be implemented in subtasks 4-2 and 4-4" is outdated since `LinearTicketDetail` (and likely the other components) are implemented in this PR.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/index.ts` at line 1,
Remove the stale placeholder comment at the top of the file; since components
like LinearTicketDetail are implemented, delete the line "// Placeholder exports
- will be implemented in subtasks 4-2 and 4-4" (or replace it with a short,
accurate comment if needed) so the file no longer contains outdated notes about
future subtasks.
```
