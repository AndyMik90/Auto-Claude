## Original Content

_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Remove unused `projectId` prop.**

The `projectId` prop is declared in the interface but never used within the component. If it's not needed, remove it to avoid confusion.


<details>
<summary>♻️ Proposed fix</summary>

```diff
 interface LinearTicketDetailProps {
 	ticket: LinearTicket | null;
-	projectId: string;
 	validationResult: ValidationResult | null;
 	isValidating: boolean;
 	onRunValidation: () => void;
 }
```

Also update the component signature and any callers accordingly.

around lines 16 - 22, The interface LinearTicketDetailProps declares an unused
projectId prop; remove projectId from the interface and from the
LinearTicketDetail component signature (LinearTicketDetail) and then update any
callers that pass projectId to stop supplying it (or pass an alternative prop if
needed) so types and usages remain consistent.
