_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_

**Consider logging exception details for debugging.**

When catching generic `Exception`, the original traceback is lost. Consider logging the full exception for debugging purposes while still returning a sanitized error message to the caller.

In `@apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py` around lines 117 - 126, The
generic except block that currently returns {"success": False, "error":
f"Validation failed: {e}"} should also log the full exception and traceback for
debugging; in the except Exception as e clause (alongside the existing
LinearValidationError handler) call your module logger (e.g.,
logger.exception(...) or logging.exception(...)) or use logging.error(...,
exc_info=True) to record the stack trace and error context, then continue
returning the sanitized error message to the caller; ensure the logger is
imported/available in the module if not already.
