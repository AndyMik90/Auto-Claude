**Consider potential keyboard shortcut conflicts.**

The shortcuts `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` (clear cache) and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F` (clear filters) may conflict with common browser/editor shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+Shift+C`: Chrome DevTools "Inspect element" or "Copy as HTML"
- `Ctrl+Shift+F`: "Find in Files" in many editors/IDEs

This is a minor consideration since the dashboard checks `isActive` and excludes input fields, but users may still experience unexpected behavior.



Consider alternative shortcuts like `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X` for clear cache or document the shortcuts prominently in the UI.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/LinearDashboard.tsx` around
lines 268 - 284, The current keyboard handlers in LinearDashboard use
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C and Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F which conflict with common browser/editor
shortcuts; update the key bindings in the keyboard handler block that triggers
handleClearCache and clearFilters (references: handleClearCache,
isClearingCache, clearFilters, hasActiveFilters, isActive) to use
less-conflicting combinations (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X for clear cache and
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+G or Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+F for clear filters) or make the shortcuts
configurable via props/settings, and ensure any UI tooling or help text is
updated to show the new shortcuts so users aren’t surprised.
