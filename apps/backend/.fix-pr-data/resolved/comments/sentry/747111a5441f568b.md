## Original Content

**Bug:** The batch validation response is missing the `ticketId` field inside the `result` object, which is inconsistent with the single validation response and the frontend `ValidationResult` type.
<sub>Severity: MEDIUM</sub>
<!-- BUG_PREDICTION -->

<details>
<summary><b title="Reference ID: `9354735`">Suggested Fix</b></summary>

Modify the batch validation response in `linear_validation_runner.py` to include `ticketId` within the `result` object, ensuring it matches the structure of the single validation response. This will align the data with the frontend's `ValidationResult` type, which expects `ticketId` to be present.

Location: apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py#L210-L218

Potential issue: The batch validation endpoint returns a list of objects, each with a
`ticketId` and a `result`. The `result` object, generated by
`_serialize_validation_result`, does not contain `ticketId`. The frontend code spreads
this `result` object when updating its store, causing the stored `ValidationResult` to
be missing the `ticketId` field. This violates the `ValidationResult` type definition
and is inconsistent with the single ticket validation flow, which correctly includes
`ticketId`. This could lead to runtime errors if frontend components access the
`ticketId` property on these stored results.

## Implementation Notes

*Status: SKIPPED*

**Resolution:** Not a bug - current structure is correct. Frontend destructures ticketId from wrapper and result separately (line 565-566 in linear-store.ts)
