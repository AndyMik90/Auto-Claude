## Code Review

The Linear integration with AI-powered ticket validation is a significant new feature, well-implemented with a clear architecture, comprehensive tests, and detailed documentation. The backend agent handles complex AI workflows, caching, and robust error handling with retries. The frontend provides a user-friendly dashboard with filtering, single and batch validation, and task creation. The new documentation is thorough and will be very helpful for users. Overall, this is a strong addition to the project.
