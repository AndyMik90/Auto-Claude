In `@apps/backend/runners/linear_validation_runner.py`:
- Line 135: The call to create_linear_validator is passing an invalid short
model alias ("opus"); update the call(s) to pass a full model identifier (e.g.,
"claude-opus-4-5-20251101") or modify create_linear_validator to accept short
aliases and map them internally; locate the create_linear_validator usages
(e.g., the agent assignments) and either replace model="opus" with the canonical
model string or add an alias-resolution layer inside create_linear_validator
that translates "opus" to the full model name before using it.

In
`@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/components/LinearTicketDetail.tsx`:
- Around line 32-35: The current useEffect uses window.scrollTo which won't
scroll a parent scrollable container; update LinearTicketDetail to create a ref
(e.g., detailRef) on the root container element and in the useEffect (watching
ticket?.id) call detailRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block:
'start' }) or detailRef.current?.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }) if you
need container-local scrolling, falling back to window.scrollTo if the ref is
null; adjust the JSX to attach the ref to the component's outermost div and keep
the same dependency (ticket?.id).
- Around line 77-286: The translation keys used in LinearTicketDetail (calls to
t(...) throughout the component) are either wrong or missing; update the
component to use the existing keys (replace t("linear:openInLinear") →
t("linear:viewOnLinear"), t("linear:validateTicket") →
t("linear:runValidation"), and t("linear:validating") →
t("linear:validatingTicket") in the button and aria labels) and add the missing
keys (ticketDetailsFor, validated, notValidated, recommendedVersion, category,
viewFullValidation) to both en/common.json and fr/common.json under the linear
namespace so all t(...) calls in LinearTicketDetail resolve to translations.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/LinearDashboard.tsx`:
- Around line 121-142: The getValidationStateForTicket callback returns several
unused hardcoded false fields (hasBlockingFindings, hasNewChanges,
hasChangesAfterPosting) with comments; update the helper and any dependent
types/components (e.g., LinearTicketList) to only include the relevant fields
(isValidating, hasResult) so the function returns a minimal validation state
based on validationResults.get(ticketId) and remove or adapt usages of the
removed properties throughout the component tree; ensure you update the function
signature and any type/interface definitions referencing the full validation
object (and adjust consumers) to avoid type errors.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/Sidebar.tsx`:
- Around line 126-134: The toggleSidebar handler uses
setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed) which can read stale state; change toggleSidebar to
use the functional updater form setIsCollapsed(prev => !prev) so toggling uses
the latest state. Update the toggleSidebar function definition (and any other
places calling setIsCollapsed) to use the functional setter to avoid race
conditions with rapid or queued updates.
- Around line 137-166: The current useEffect delays clearing envConfig until
after the async IPC returns, causing stale nav visibility; in the loadEnvConfig
function (used inside the useEffect that depends on selectedProject?.id and
selectedProject?.autoBuildPath) call setEnvConfig(null) immediately when
selectedProject?.autoBuildPath is present (before awaiting
window.electronAPI.getProjectEnv) so the UI clears while the IPC call runs, then
update envConfig with the result only if not cancelled; preserve the existing
cancelled check and error handling around window.electronAPI.getProjectEnv and
keep setting null on errors.

In `@apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/common.json`:
- Around line 382-459: The French `linear` locale is missing 14 keys that exist
in English; add the following keys inside the existing "linear" object in
apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/common.json with proper French
translations: validatingTicket; validationFailed and validationFailedDesc;
ticketValidated; cacheCleared and validationCacheClearedDesc; cacheClearFailed
and cacheClearFailedDesc; taskCreatedSuccess; batchValidationProgress,
batchValidationComplete, batchValidationPartial; connectionCheckSuccess and
connectionCheckFailed. Ensure each new key follows the same naming/templating
conventions as neighboring entries (use placeholders like {{error}} or {{count}}
where appropriate) so the UI no longer falls back to English or shows raw keys.
