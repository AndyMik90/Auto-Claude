```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py`:
- Around line 850-867: The fallback return in linear_validator.py returns a
completeness field with "feasibility" as a string but the schema expects
"feasibility_score" (0–100); update the fallback object returned by the function
that builds the minimal result (the dict using issue_id, issue_data,
current_version) to replace "feasibility": "needs_clarification" with a numeric
"feasibility_score" (e.g., 0 or a sentinel like -1 if unknown) and ensure any
downstream key "rating" remains consistent with the documented schema; use
issue_data, issue_id, and current_version symbols in the same object and keep
the rest of the fields unchanged.
- Around line 618-651: The code calls a non-existent
ClaudeSDKClient.create_agent_session inside run_validation_session; replace that
call with the existing helper run_agent_session (imported from agents.session)
and keep the asyncio.wait_for timeout wrapper. Specifically, in
run_validation_session call run_agent_session(client, prompt, self.spec_dir,
verbose=False, phase=LogPhase.CODING), await the tuple (status, response) and
return response (same as before), preserve the asyncio.TimeoutError handling and
raise ValidationTimeoutError, and ensure run_agent_session is imported at top of
the file.
