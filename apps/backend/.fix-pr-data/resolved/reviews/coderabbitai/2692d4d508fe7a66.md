```
In `@apps/backend/tests/test_linear_similarity_agent.py`:
- Around line 229-289: Remove redundant local imports and the unused variable in
the async tests: in test_fetch_team_tickets_is_async and
test_multiple_fetches_run_concurrently, delete the local "import asyncio" lines
(they duplicate the module-level import) and remove the unused "original_post"
assignment in test_multiple_fetches_run_concurrently; keep the mocking/patching
logic that replaces agent_module.requests.post and the try/finally restore.
Ensure references to _fetch_team_tickets and agent_module.requests.post remain
unchanged.
```
