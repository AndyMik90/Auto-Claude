```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py`:
- Around line 24-25: The imports for diskcache and requests are used in
apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py but are missing from the backend
requirements; update apps/backend/requirements.txt to add both package names
(diskcache and requests) with appropriate versions (or leave version pins
consistent with the project's constraints) so imports in linear_validator.py
succeed at runtime.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/linear/hooks/useLinearTickets.ts`:
- Around line 141-165: The code in useLinearTickets calls
window.electronAPI.checkLinearConnection without verifying electronAPI is
available, which can throw in browser/mock contexts; before invoking
checkLinearConnection in the try block, guard that window?.electronAPI and
window.electronAPI.checkLinearConnection exist and if not set isConnected(false)
and call useLinearStore.getState().setError with a controlled message (e.g.,
"Electron API unavailable"); only call fetchLinearTickets(projectId) after the
guarded call succeeds. Update references in this block
(window.electronAPI.checkLinearConnection, fetchLinearTickets,
useLinearStore.getState().setError, setIsConnected) to follow this pattern.

In `@apps/frontend/src/renderer/stores/linear-store.ts`:
- Around line 2-8: The import block that brings in LinearFilters, LinearProject,
LinearTeam, LinearTicket, and ValidationResult uses a relative path
("../../shared/types"); update it to use the configured TypeScript path alias by
importing from "shared/types" instead so the renderer code uses the shared/*
alias consistently (ensure tsconfig.json path mappings are respected and the
same change is applied wherever "../../shared/..." appears in
src/renderer/**/*.{ts,tsx}).
