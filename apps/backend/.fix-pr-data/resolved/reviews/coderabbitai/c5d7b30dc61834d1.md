```
In `@apps/backend/agents/linear_validator.py`:
- Around line 844-845: Remove the fragile regex fallback that searches for
r"(\{.*?\})" because nested JSON is already handled by the balanced-brace logic
(the block around lines 828-843); delete the fallback assignment to json_match
and any subsequent reliance on it (uses of json_match and response), so only the
balanced brace extractor is used as the final fallback for extracting JSON.
Ensure no other code expects json_match to exist after that point and adjust
control flow accordingly.
- Around line 96-100: The parameter func in retry_with_exponential_backoff is an
async callable but is typed as Callable[..., T]; update its type hint to reflect
an awaitable return (e.g., Callable[..., Awaitable[T]] or Callable[...,
Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]) so the signature accurately indicates func must be
asynchronous and returns T when awaited; modify the function definition for
retry_with_exponential_backoff accordingly and import any needed typing symbols
(Awaitable or Coroutine).
