# Copilot Instructions

## Repo / Branch Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- Use `https://github.com/vzwjustin/Auto-Claude.git` as the authoritative remote.
- Always work on and push to the `develop` branch.
- Default: do not push to or open PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`.
- Exception: only do so when the user explicitly requests it.

If git reports commits "ahead" of an upstream remote, do not push them upstream. Ensure the local `develop` branch tracks `vzwjustin/develop`.
