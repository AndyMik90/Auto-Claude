## Prompt

```
You are a business development analyst. Generate a briefing document in Markdown for the following opportunity.

**Job Opportunity:**
- Job Title: {Job Title}
- Company hiring: {Company Name}
- Location: {Location}
- Clearance: {Clearance Level}
- Program Tag: {Program Name (identified)}
- Customer Agency: {Agency}
- Prime Contractor: {Prime (if different from Company)}
- Contract Vehicle: {Contract vehicle or contract name if known, else "Unknown"}
- Job Description Summary: "{One or two-line summary of what the job does}"

**Program Background:**
{Program Name} – {One sentence description of the program's purpose/mission.}
This program is for {Agency} and is primarily executed by {Prime Contractor}.
{Add one more key detail, e.g., timeline or budget if known}.

**Key Contacts:**
{List 2-3 key contacts or roles from org chart, e.g.:
- Jane Doe – Program Manager at {Prime Contractor} (oversees {Program Name})
- John Smith – Technical Director, {Agency} {Program Name} Office
}
*(If no specific names, list roles to target.)*

**Business Opportunity Insights:**
- {Company Name} hiring for this role suggests {explain why this hire is happening – e.g. expansion, new contract award, backfill on project, etc., based on context}.
- The required skills ({mention any unique tech from the job}) align with {Program Name}'s needs, indicating this position is directly supporting the program.
- The contract is handled via {Contract Vehicle or "an unknown contract vehicle"}, which implies {if known, e.g. "it's a task order under ABC IDIQ" or if unknown skip}.
- Competition: {If Prime Contractor is hiring, they are incumbent; if a subcontractor hiring, mention competition scenario. Or note any major competitor if known from program intel.}

**Recommendations (Next Steps):**
- Reach out to the Program Manager (or appropriate contact) at {Prime Contractor} to introduce our company's capabilities and inquire about subcontracting opportunities.
- Connect with the agency's office (e.g., {Agency} acquisition or program office) to understand upcoming procurement or task orders related to {Program Name}.
- Monitor for any news or updates on {Program Name} (budget changes, new phases, re-compete timelines).
- Prepare a capabilities statement highlighting relevant experience to {Program Name}'s mission (especially focusing on {mention any tech or domain from the job that we have experience in}).

Format the briefing neatly in Markdown with headings for each section. Use bullet points where appropriate (as above). Keep it concise (1-2 pages max). Include all key data provided. Do not fabricate information not given.
