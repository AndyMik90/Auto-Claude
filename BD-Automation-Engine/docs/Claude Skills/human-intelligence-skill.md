# HUMINT Intelligence Gathering

Systematic approach to gathering human intelligence for BD campaigns. Build from lower-tier contacts up to decision-makers, arriving with credibility, insider knowledge, and solutions.

**Keywords**: HUMINT, intelligence gathering, pain points, insider knowledge, contact sequencing, decision maker, program manager, staffing, defense contractor

## Core Principle

**Lower-tier resources gather intelligence BEFORE approaching decision-makers.**

The goal is to transform cold calls into warm introductions by:
1. Building relationships with ICs who know the team dynamics
2. Learning actual pain points from people doing the work
3. Identifying hiring manager names and decision criteria
4. Understanding budget cycles and procurement timelines
5. Approaching PMs/Execs with credibility and solutions

## Tiered Intelligence Approach

| Tier | Role | Purpose | Intelligence Gathered |
|------|------|---------|----------------------|
| 5-6 | Individual Contributors | Relationship building | Team dynamics, actual pain points, hiring manager names |
| 4 | Managers/Team Leads | Validate intel | Budget cycles, upcoming requirements, vendor preferences |
| 3 | Program Managers | Present solutions | Decision criteria, procurement timelines, teaming opportunities |
| 1-2 | Executives/Directors | Strategic alignment | Portfolio direction, enterprise partnerships |

## Intelligence Categories

### 1. Team Dynamics
- Team size and structure
- Reporting relationships
- Who actually makes hiring decisions
- Contractor vs. government ratio
- Current vendor relationships

### 2. Pain Points
- Current staffing gaps
- Skill shortages
- Process bottlenecks
- Technology challenges
- Budget constraints
- Timeline pressures

### 3. Hiring Intelligence
- Open positions (confirmed vs. planned)
- Hiring manager names
- Approval process
- Timeline to fill
- Budget availability
- Preferred vendors

### 4. Program Intelligence
- Contract status (base vs. option years)
- Upcoming recompetes
- Task order structure
- Key deliverables/milestones
- Customer satisfaction levels

## Conversation Framework by Tier

### Tier 5-6 (ICs) - Discovery Calls

**Objective:** Build rapport, gather team intel

**Questions to Ask:**
```
- "What does your day-to-day look like on [PROGRAM]?"
- "How big is your team currently?"
- "Are you seeing any skill gaps on the team?"
- "Who handles hiring for your group?"
- "What's the mix of contractors vs. government?"
- "What tools/technologies are you working with?"
```

**What to Document:**
- Team size and structure
- Manager/lead names mentioned
- Pain points expressed (even casually)
- Technology stack
- Sentiment about current situation

### Tier 4 (Managers) - Validation Calls

**Objective:** Validate IC intel, understand requirements

**Questions to Ask:**
```
- "I understand your team is dealing with [PAIN POINT from IC]..."
- "What positions are hardest to fill right now?"
- "What's your timeline for bringing on new support?"
- "How does your hiring process typically work?"
- "Who else should I be talking to about staffing needs?"
```

**What to Document:**
- Confirmation/correction of IC intel
- Specific position requirements
- Budget/approval process
- Decision-maker names
- Timing and urgency

### Tier 3 (PMs) - Solution Presentation

**Objective:** Present capabilities, propose partnership

**Armed With:**
- Validated pain points from Tiers 4-6
- Specific position requirements
- Understanding of decision process
- Relevant past performance

**Approach:**
```
"Based on conversations with your team, I understand you're 
dealing with [PAIN POINTS]. We've supported similar challenges 
on [RELEVANT PROGRAM] and have [SPECIFIC CAPABILITY] that 
could help..."
```

### Tier 1-2 (Executives) - Strategic Alignment

**Objective:** Enterprise-level partnership

**Prerequisites:**
- Multiple successful engagements at lower tiers
- Clear understanding of portfolio priorities
- Executive-to-executive introduction if possible

## Pain Point Tracking by Program

### AF DCGS - PACAF (San Diego) 🔥

| Pain Point | Source | Validated | Action |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Acting site lead wearing multiple hats | Tier 6 IC | ✅ | Target for support |
| Single points of failure | Tier 5 Sr. | ✅ | Redundancy solution |
| No backup for network/security | Tier 4 Mgr | ⚠️ Verify | Specialist placement |

### AF DCGS - Langley

| Pain Point | Source | Validated | Action |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| High ISR volume | Tier 6 IC | ✅ | Analyst augmentation |
| Analyst burnout | Tier 5 Sr. | ✅ | Additional headcount |
| PMO pressure on vacancies | Tier 3 PM | ✅ | Pipeline briefing |

### AF DCGS - Wright-Patt

| Pain Point | Source | Validated | Action |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Radar engineer vacancy | Tier 4 Mgr | ✅ | Specialized search |
| DevSecOps shortage | Tier 5 Sr. | ⚠️ Verify | Platform One talent |

## Intelligence Validation Rules

1. **Single source = Unvalidated**
   - Mark as ⚠️ until confirmed by second contact

2. **Two+ sources = Validated**
   - Mark as ✅, prioritize for outreach

3. **Contradicting intel = Investigate**
   - Note discrepancy, seek third source

4. **Stale intel (>30 days) = Reverify**
   - Situations change, confirm before using

## CRM Integration Fields

When logging HUMINT in CRM/Notion:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Intel Source | Contact Link | Who provided this |
| Intel Type | Select | Pain Point, Hiring, Structure, Other |
| Program | Select | Which program this relates to |
| Confidence | Select | Validated, Unvalidated, Stale |
| Date Gathered | Date | When collected |
| Notes | Long Text | Full context |
| Action Required | Checkbox | Needs follow-up |

## Escalation Triggers

Move up the tier ladder when:

- ✅ 3+ validated pain points documented
- ✅ Hiring manager name confirmed
- ✅ Budget/timeline understood
- ✅ Relevant past performance identified
- ✅ Specific positions mapped to capabilities

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Approaching executives before gathering HUMINT
- ❌ Using unvalidated intel in outreach
- ❌ Revealing sources to higher tiers
- ❌ Skipping tier levels without justification
- ❌ Not documenting conversations
- ❌ Treating intel as permanent (situations change)
