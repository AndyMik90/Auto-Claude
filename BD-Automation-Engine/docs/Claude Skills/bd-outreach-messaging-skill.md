# BD Outreach Messaging - The PTS Formula

Transform cold calls into warm introductions using the 6-step BD Formula with program-specific personalization, pain points, and past performance alignment.

**Keywords**: BD formula, outreach, messaging, cold call, warm introduction, personalization, pain points, past performance, email template, call script

## The 6-Step BD Formula

Every outreach follows this exact sequence to differentiate from staffing competitors:

### Step 1: Personalized Message
Role-specific icebreaker demonstrating knowledge of their work/program.

**DO:**
- Reference their specific site, team, or recent activity
- Show understanding of their operational context
- Mention specific program or mission they support

**DON'T:**
- Use generic "I saw your profile" openings
- Start with company pitch
- Lead with what you're selling

**Examples:**
```
✅ "I noticed you're supporting the 480th ISR Wing's DCGS operations at Langley..."
✅ "Given your work on the PACAF node in San Diego..."
❌ "Hi, I'm from PTS and we do staffing..."
```

### Step 2: Current Pain Points
Program-specific challenges sourced from HUMINT:

| Program | Pain Points |
|---------|-------------|
| AF DCGS - PACAF 🔥 | Acting site lead stretched thin, single points of failure, no redundancy |
| AF DCGS - Langley | High ISR volume, analyst burnout, PMO pressure on vacancies |
| AF DCGS - Wright-Patt | Radar engineer vacancy, DevSecOps shortage for modernization |
| Army DCGS-A | Surge staffing needs, coordination across dispersed sites |
| Navy DCGS-N | Ship/shore integration challenges, Norfolk talent competition |

**Pain Point Framing:**
```
"I understand [PROGRAM] teams are dealing with [PAIN POINT]. 
Many programs like yours face [RELATED CHALLENGE]..."
```

### Step 3: Labor Gaps & Open Jobs
Current vacancies at their location showing awareness of their hiring challenges.

**Data Sources:**
- GDIT Jobs database (700+ positions)
- Program Mapping Intelligence Hub (scraped jobs)
- ZoomInfo hiring signals

**Example:**
```
"I see your team has open positions for [JOB TITLE 1] and [JOB TITLE 2] 
at the [LOCATION] site..."
```

### Step 4: PTS Past Performance with GDIT
Direct partnership history establishes credibility:

| Program | Description | Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| BICES/BICES-X | TS/SCI network engineers & analysts (Norfolk, Tampa, Europe) | Coalition intel networks |
| GSM-O II | Network engineers for 24/7 DISA operations | Critical infrastructure |
| NATO BICES | Coalition intel network analysts | International operations |

**Credibility Statement:**
```
"PTS has supported GDIT on [PROGRAM] since [YEAR], providing 
[ROLE TYPE] for [MISSION/FUNCTION]..."
```

### Step 5: Relevant Past Performance to Program
Similar program experience mapping to their specific needs:

| Their Program | Relevant PTS Experience | Connection |
|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| AF DCGS | SOCOM JICCENT | Joint Intelligence Center, ISR |
| AF DCGS | Platform One | USAF DevSecOps, modernization |
| Army DCGS-A | Army RS3 | C4ISR engineers |
| Navy DCGS-N | DIA I2OS | Software integration |
| All DCGS | DISA JRSS | Multi-site network security |

### Step 6: Past Performance Relevant to Job Title
Match PTS capabilities to their team function:

| They Need | PTS Delivers |
|-----------|--------------|
| Cyber Analysts | Cleared cyber portfolio (BICES, JRSS) |
| Network Engineers | DISA/coalition network experience |
| ISR Analysts | Intel community placements |
| Software Engineers | Platform One DevSecOps talent |
| System Admins | 24/7 ops support (GSM-O II) |
