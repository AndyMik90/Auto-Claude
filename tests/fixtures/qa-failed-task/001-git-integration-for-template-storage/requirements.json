  "task_description": "# Git Integration for Template Storage\n\nEnable synchronization of templates with Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps). Allow bidirectional sync, commit history viewing, and branch management.\n\n## Rationale\nGit integration for template storage is a known gap. Development teams expect version control workflows. Git integration enables code review, branching strategies, and CI/CD integration.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an Integration Engineer, I want to sync templates with Git so that I can use standard version control workflows\n- As a Team Lead, I want templates in Git so that we can integrate with our CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can connect their Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps)\n- [ ] Templates can be pushed to and pulled from Git\n- [ ] Commit history is visible within the application\n- [ ] Branch management allows working on features separately\n- [ ] Merge conflicts are detected and can be resolved\n- [ ] Webhooks trigger updates on repository changes\n",
