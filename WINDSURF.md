## Repo / Branch Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **Authoritative remote:** `https://github.com/vzwjustin/Auto-Claude.git`
- **Authoritative branch:** `develop`
- **Default:** do not push to or create PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`.
- **Exception:** only push to / create PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude` when the user explicitly requests it.

### Operational rules

- If the local remote `origin` points to `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`, do **not** push to it.
- Ensure local `develop` tracks `vzwjustin/develop`.
- All changes must be committed and pushed to `vzwjustin/develop` only.
